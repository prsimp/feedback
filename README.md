# Ask away!

If you have questions, comments, issues, concerns, gripes, or moans about me, 
things I've written, the weather, or anything else, you can file an issue [on this
project](https://github.com/prsimp/feedback/issues/new) and I'll resposne as quickly
as humanly possible.

Brilliant idea, Zach! I'm copying it - hope you don't mind :)
